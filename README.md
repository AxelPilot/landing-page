# Landing Page Project
## Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Program

### Description
The aim of this project is to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

Languages used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Functionality
* Navigational menu updates dynamically based on site contents.
* Section and menu active states update dynamically based on scroll position.
* When clicking an item in the navigational menu, the link scrolls to the appropriate section.
* When clicking the chevron in a section heading, the section toggles between being collapsed and uncollapsed.
* When scrolling down from the top of the page, a button appears in the lower right hand corner of the window. Clicking this button scrolls automatically to the top of the page.
